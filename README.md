This week we were tasked with *modifying* *starter* *code* to create an application that enables users to *generate* *random* *passwords*
These are the website links I looked at to get through this challenge:

I read *modify* " *javascript* " *starter* *code* , forgetting the *index.html* and *style.css* files.
As a Bootcamp Student, I may need to do more (beyond the required 20 hours) self study outside of class in order to fully grasp and be comfortable with JavaScript.
